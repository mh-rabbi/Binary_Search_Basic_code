# Binary_Search_Basic_code_in_C++
Binary Search is a part of searching algorithm in a sorted array which is most efficient rather than a linear search algorithm. <br>
The time complexity of binary search is, therefore, O(logn). <br>
This is much more efficient than the linear time O(n), especially for large values of n.<br>
Try to lear best case and worst case in time complexity term.<br>
